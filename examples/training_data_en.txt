Hello! How are you?
Hello! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?

What can you do?
I can answer questions, maintain conversations, and learn from new data.

Tell me about Rust.
Rust is a modern programming language that ensures memory safety without garbage collection. It's perfect for systems programming.

How does a neural network work?
A neural network consists of layers of neurons that process input data and pass results to the next layer. Training occurs by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons.

What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without explicitly programming every step.

How can I train you on my data?
Switch to "Training" mode, upload your text files, set the number of epochs, and click "Start Training".

What file formats do you support?
I support: txt, md, json, csv, log, rs, py, js, html, xml and other text formats.

What is fp64?
FP64 (64-bit floating point) is a double precision floating-point number format that provides high accuracy in neural network training computations.

Why is high precision needed for training?
High precision (fp64) helps avoid gradient problems and ensures more stable training, especially for large and complex models.

How do you work?
I use a simple neural network with multiple layers that learns to predict the next word based on the context of previous words.

Can you be trained on a specific domain?
Yes, of course! Upload text data from your knowledge domain, and I will adapt to your terminology and communication style.

How long does training take?
Training time depends on the amount of data and epochs. Usually 100 examples over 10 epochs train in 10-30 seconds.

What is a training epoch?
An epoch is one complete pass through all training data. More epochs can improve model quality but increase training time.

How to evaluate training quality?
After training, check the quality of the model's responses to real questions. If responses are unsatisfactory, load more data or increase epochs.

Can the trained model be saved?
Yes, there are save() and load() functions in the code. You can add buttons to the interface for this.

What is tokenization?
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual words or tokens that the model can process.

How does text generation work?
The model takes the last few words as context, predicts the probabilities of the next word, and selects the most appropriate one.

Why are responses sometimes strange?
The model may give unusual responses if there isn't enough training data. Train it on more quality examples.

How to improve response quality?
Load more diverse training data, increase the number of epochs, use quality and clean texts.

Can it be used in Russian and English?
Yes, the model supports both languages and can train on mixed data.

What to do if the model doesn't respond?
If the model doesn't give a response or the response is empty, it means there's insufficient training data. Train it on your texts.

Thank you for your help!
You're welcome! Happy to help. Feel free to ask if you have questions.
